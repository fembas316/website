I am an engineer with keen interest in research, data analysis, process design and optimization.  I have a chemical engineering bachelor's degree, and a master's degree in engineering and public policy. I will commence my PhD studies in chemical engineering at Ryerson University in January 2021. Professionally, I have had stints in water, wastewater, manufacturing, and food & beverage industries. I have been actively involved in oil and gas regulatory activities, overseeing crude oil treatment, quality control/assurance, export, metering/meter proving operations. I have also been involved in the supervision of produced formation water treatment and disposal, process/laboratory analysis and continuous improvement. My experience also cut across comprehensive researches informing policies and decision making. I am open-minded towards fresh challenges as that is my greatest motivation.

In my 10 years work experience, I have developed expertise, and harness my skills in different capacities. First, I worked as a process engineer with Consolidated Breweries Plc (now Nigerian Breweries), where I later served as an environmental analyst. I also worked as a collaborative researcher with the United Nations Institute for Water, Environment, and Health in Canada. My recent experience as a chemical engineer with the Department of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria involves environmental regulations in the oil and gas industry. I regulate the treatment and safe disposal of petroleum formation produced water (wastewater). My experience have further fuelled my proposed PhD research to adapt nanotechnology in water/wastewater treatment.
