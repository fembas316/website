* M.Eng. Engineering and Public Policy, McMaster University-Canada, 2018
* Ph.D Chemical Engineering, Ryerson University, 2024 (expected)

Work experience
======
* 2018-2020: Senior Chemical Engineer (Department of Petroleum Resources, Nigeria)
  * Reduction in incurred shipping demurrage through improved and efficient operations management
  * 0.5% improvement in crude oil revenue, by consistently developing quality control/assurance mechanisms, maintaining crude’s BS&W below 0.5% in every export
  * Improved production computating accuracy, using MS excel computing programming to eliminate errors, and also reducing production and export computation time
  * Improved market integrity, by adopting API standards, ASTM and other international standards in the review and update of procedure guidelines and operating procedures. 

* 2017-2018: Collaborative Research (United Nations Institute for Water, Environment, and Health-Canada)
  * Review of regulatory frameworks guiding hydraulic fracturing and groundwater protection
  * Analysis of public health effect of insufficient groundwater quality monitoring in Nigeria
  * Comparative analysis of Merit brewing water usage with other small-scale breweries and brew pubs, and developed strategies that reduced brewery water consumption by 15%.
  
* 2013-2017: Chemical Engineer (Department of Petroleum Resources, Nigeria)
  * Supervised operators and technologists in the treatment, storage, and export of Nigeria’s crude oil
  * Conducted economic and feasibility studies on petroleum exploration and production
  * Conducted evidence-based researches on improving procedure guidelines for the determination of quality and quantity of Nigeria’s petroleum and petroleum products
  * Enforced environmental regulations guiding treatment and discharge of petroleum formation water (wastewater)
  
* 2011-2013: Process Engineer (Consolidated Breweries Plc., Nigeria)
  * Optimization of process water treatment plant, through engineering calculations, determining the appropriate treating chemical dosage, resulting in 5% reduced chemical cost
  * Redesigned water treatment maintenance schedules to reduce haze and turbidity in beer, and hence, improved the quality of beer
  * Process modifications improving the quality of beer, through researches into optimum blend of raw materials, leading to 25% increase in sales
  * 20% reduction in thermal energy usage through ensured boiler condensate recovery, reduced convective losses and improved boiler feed water quality.
