Mentoring
======
* 2017-till date: Scholarship Enthusiasts Group, Nigeria
  * I provide mentorship to a group of people (20 mentees) in search of local and international postgraduate scholarships. 
  * About 55% of my mentees have been awarded various international scholarships.

* 2018-2020: Department of Petroleum Resources, Nigeria
  * I was responsible for bringing the newly recruited engineers in my department up to speed
  * I provided training and guidance to the ten (10) recruits assigned to me, in two batches of 5 mentees per batch
  * I  provided feedback both on each mentee. The feedback provided an avenue for self appraisal, identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses
  *	I designed Individual training and developmental plans for the mentees, and followed through the plans.
  
* 2006-2009: Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Nigeria
  * I provided academic mentorship to students, particularly targeting new students
  * I fixed a large number of students into different academic mentoring sub-groups, within my academic network through which I mentored 24 students to academic excellence
